# Ship of Theseus
A frontend website that shows and explains the philosophical idea of the ship of Theseus.


	Using Next Js, Chakra UI, Framer Motion and Three.js. 

	The website is a derivative from my main portfolio website that was originally built by 
	https://github.com/craftzdog. 
	
	To run do: npm run dev
	
	
	
My model was bought on https://sketchfab.com/.

I keep the website running using Vercel, since this is mainly frontend. 
It's an interesting idea to me and thatâ€™s mainly why I thought that this would be a cool thing to 
do whilst I learned more about using Next Js with Three Js. Specifically, because I wanted to create a
website with models running in the background. 

	I was angry with my friend; 
	I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
	I was angry with my foe: 
	I told it not, my wrath did grow.
