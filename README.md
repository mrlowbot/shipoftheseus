# Ship of Theseus
A frontend website that shows and explains the philosophical idea of the ship of Theseus.

Using Next Js, Chakra UI and Three.js. 

The website is a derivative from my main portfolio website that was originally built by 
https://github.com/craftzdog. 

However this was mainly built by me as most of it is changed compared to the original.

Its okay to use the code as you wish but the model of the boat is my own and was bought. 
If you wish to buy it as well then check out https://sketchfab.com/.
