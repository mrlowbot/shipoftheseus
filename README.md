# The ship of Theseus
  #### This is a hobby project about a philosophical idea showcased using different front end tools.
  
_If we replace all the parts of the ship, is it still the same ~~[ship](https://www.the-ship-of-theseus.com/)~~?_


###### The main point of this website is to simply explain the idea of the ship of Theseus and to allow for an interesting conclusion.

  #### By using
  * ##### [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/) (deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/))
  * ##### [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
  * ##### [Three Js](https://threejs.org/)
  * ##### [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

  ##### We can create a website that showcases a model in a nice way. 

      > comps:    Components such as loading the boat model, fonts, chakra, navbar etc.
      > lib:      Specific detailes for the theme and model.
      > pages:    _app.js and index.js.
      > public:   Boat model and photos for logo and svg. 
 
 
   ###### To run:
       > npm run dev

  ###### I bought my model from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/feed). This whole project was inspired by [Craftzdog's](https://github.com/craftzdog/craftzdog-homepage) main website.
